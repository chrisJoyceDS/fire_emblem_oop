## Fire Emblem: Practicing Object Oriented Programming

As I continue to seek employment after being laid off in January of this year and graduating from General Assembly's Data Science bootcamp, I keep looking for different projects to self start and learn. Trouble I am running into is how to simulteneously learn and apply different kinds of concepts across Data Science, Engineering, Software Engineering, Statistics, etc. into one project. To make it simpler, I am going forward until I have some more proficiency and understanding going to separate different skills into different project. For this project I am going to focus on OOP in Python as well as overall system design, performance, and measurements.

Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade is a tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld video game console, more can be read about the game <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_The_Blazing_Blade'>here </a>. (I highly recommend btw).

This is a game I am very familiar with and it's simple design provides the perfect opportunity to practice OOP design as well as system design.

More to come!!
